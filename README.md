In this project, I used Machine Learning Algorithms to predict a company's credit rating. The ratings were predicted by several ML algorithmns, which were trained using well known financial ratios. Credit Rating agencies such as Moody's or Standard & Poor's also use financial ratios of a company to give them a credit rating. Obviously, the exact models these companies use are not known. In reality, they most likely include more data such as macroeconomic data and other information that are not "known" to the general public.
